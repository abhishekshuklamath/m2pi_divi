Team project on reverse compressibility of blockchain data

Since its inception in 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain has grown in size to more than 295 GB and continues to grow by approximately 50 GB per year. The decentralized, trustless framework of Blockchain requires participating nodes to store the entire blockchain data. This keeps smaller computing devices from participating fully in the network.

In this paper, we present methods to compress the blockchain in a lossless fashion. Our main observations rely on Ô¨Ånding redundancies in the Bitcoin transaction data which can be leveraged to decrease the blockchain size. We are able to achieve a compression rate of approximately 20% by applying various compression schemes in concert. Further compression might be possible by using generic compression algorithms on top of our compression scheme.
